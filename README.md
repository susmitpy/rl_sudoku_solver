Solving Sudoku Using Reinforcement Learning

sudoku.js is a JS library which has been copied (and slightly modified) from https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js

sudoku_gen.js is used to generate sudoku problems. The problems are stored in a json file named "sudokus.json".

sudokus_reader.py is then used to read the sudoku problems from the json file as numpy arrays.
